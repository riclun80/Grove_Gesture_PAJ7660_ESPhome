[Grove - Gesture（PAJ7660)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/Grove-Gesture（PAJ7620U2）-p-2463.html)

**Description**<br>
The sensor on the Grove Smart IR Gesture Sensor (PAJ7660/PAG7660) integrates a gesture recognition function with a I2C/SPI/USB interface<br>
configurable by DIP switches.<br>
It has 2 IR LED's, so it recognises gestures in complete darkness!<br>
This code utilises the I2C interface and can recognize 17 types of gestures, such as:<br> 
Static finger 1 to 5, Push finger 1 to 5, Clockwise rotation, Counter-clockwise rotation, Swipe Left, Swipe Right, Tap, Grab, Pinch.

**Installation**<br>
Place the files in the ESPHome folder so the component files end up under \esphome\components\pag7660v2<br>
Add the lines from paj7660.yaml in your ESP devices config YAML to get a "text sensor" with the last **gesture** and a "sensor" with **rotation step**.
